- The [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/) [[platform]] has many [[LLM models]] to try out in their "==Spaces==" section. 
- You can create a space (==host your own ML app==) (like a github repo but for ML with GPU etc.) in "Spaces" section, or check out spaces created by others (many interesting use cases).
- Almost all ==models and their variations==, like [[quantization]], [[fine tuning]], etc.
- It is a good website for reading [[concepts]] from their ==docs==.
