### [Say What You See](https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/say-what-you-see/jwG3m7wQShZngw) 
learn to prompt. The system generates an image (via ai) and user has to enter a prompt (text) that will generate an image which is similar to the one generated by the system. Interesting to note that the images which the system generates as a question are based on actual paintings (or artworks) from around the world. The system also provides "pro tips" to improve the prompt after accessing user's generated image.

### Speaking Practice
A topic is selected by LLM at random and 3 words are given as keywords to be used by the user in his speech. Then the conversation proceeds like a chat with LLM, however, the system responds in text, but the user responds in voice. It is a fun game.
